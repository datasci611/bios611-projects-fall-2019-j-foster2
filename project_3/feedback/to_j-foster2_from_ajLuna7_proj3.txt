# Feedback from ajLuna7 on Project 3

## Overall feedback
--The code is well-documented and your README states what you want to explore, however there needs to be more explained in terms of visualization and what your overall aim is for this project. I look forward to seeing the final product. Nice work so far. 

Provide feedback about the following topics:
1. Is the project organized modularly, with Make as the workflow manager?
--Yes, a Makefile is included. As of now, it is organized modularly. 

2. Does the project use both Python (Pandas specifically) and R (Tidyverse specifically) scripts?
--Yes, Python and R are used for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization. You document your code well and it is organized into readable chunks. Effective.

3. Is Docker used to define execution environments appropriately?
--Not yet, but the author knows they need to include a Dockerfile. 


4. Are the plots appropriate for the data types, the hypotheses being tested, and the points being communicated?
--Yes, the plots are appropriate given what the README states, which is to look at the distribution of food given in relation to Client Race.


5. How can the project be organized or documented more clearly?
--Maybe for your README, it would be helpful to include some initial questions to help the reader know what problems/questions you are trying to address. 


6. Is the purpose of the project communicated clearly?
--Yes, the README is descriptive. Should include more information, like Methods, Takeaways, Conclusion, etc. 

7. Does the purpose of the project make sense from the clientâ€™s point of view? How could the project better serve the client?
--At the moment, the results are little unclear. It would be beneficial to have some kind of discussion or explanation of graphs. As of now, you just have the code, which is difficult to understand for non-programmers. 


8. Is the source of the data made clear? (Remember that this project can be part of your public portfolios, so people not familiar with UMD may see it).
--Yes, it is made clear. 


9. Is the interpretation of figures clearly explained?
--Not really. The figures need explanation. What does the violin graph mean to people who do not understand that kind of visualization? What story are you trying to tell by looking at Food and Race? 


10. Is the purpose and interpretation of analysis steps clearly communicated?
--No, you should include a methods section. Make it easy to understand for non-specialists.


11. Are overall take-home messages clearly communicated?
--No, not yet. You should include Takeaways at the beginning and reiterate them in the conclusion.
