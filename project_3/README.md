### Project Overview

The analyses performed here were conducted on data collected by Urban ministries of Durham(UMD), a non-profit organization that is helping reduce homelessness. UMD originally founded in 1983 works to end poverty and homelessness by offering food, shelter and futures to community members. Here I focus on analyzing demographic data. The goal of the analysis is to gain insight into what groups are finding aid at UMD, and to determine if there are any biases connected to age, gender or race. Given on of the central methods through which UMD is helpign to end homelessness is food I hope to look at the food provided acros race, age, and gender.  

The analyses provided here are meant to help guide the leaders and manegers of UMD. The idea being to help them understand if the current system is pdoviding disproportionate services to any one group.

### Analysis

Please refer to data found in results directory.

For the draft I was able to look at the distributoin of food to clients that identify as either African-American or White. This analysis assumes that the client IDs refer to the same people. Also, the demographics data set incldues several client IDs that are not found in the services provided data set. Therefore, it is hard to make an inferences about the relationship between race and food provided for given the small numbers that are represented in each group. I plan on looking at these data to find better questions. For the final draft I will also look at how food and clothing is distributed across gender and client age.
