### Project Overview

The analyses performed here were conducted on data collected by Urban ministries of Durham(UMD), a non-profit organization that is helping reduce homelessness. UMD originally founded in 1983 works to end poverty and homelessness by offering food, shelter and futures to community members. Here I focus on analyzing data relevant to the distribution of food. I look to determine if UMD is growing in its capacity to provide more food year-over-year. As well as understanding how different aspects of the UMD-client interaction may effect the demand for food services.
