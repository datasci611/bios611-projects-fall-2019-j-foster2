### Project Overview

The dashborad provided here was built to analyze data collected by Urban ministries of Durham(UMD), a non-profit organization that is helping reduce homelessness. UMD originally founded in 1983 works to end poverty and homelessness by offering food, shelter and futures to community members. Here I focus on providing an interactive application that can be used by UMD to better understand their own data and to hopefully find trends that will inform future decisions. Specifically, I look to provide a tool through which trends in food, clothing, and diaper distribution can be better understood by the staff of UMD.
